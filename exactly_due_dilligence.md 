## Funds Management

- Exactly does not delegate funds to another protocol.

## Rug-ability

**Multi-sig:**
The multisig has a timelock in order to communicate and give time to the users using the protocol to react to any change made by the Risk Management Committee.

Exactly began with centralized governance of the protocolâ€™s parameters in order to get product market fit and will transition to a complete decentralization over time where the Risk Management Committee multisig will be replaced by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and EXA tokens will be minted to the community.


**Upgradable Contracts:**
The following contracts are upgradeable and can be changed by the TimelockController:

### Bug Bounty program
Exactly Protocol partnered with Immunefi to offer a Bug Bounty Program to incentivize security researchers to find vulnerabilities in our protocol, rewarding individuals who can identify and report security flaws.
Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2. This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.
You can access the program at the following link: https://immunefi.com/bounty/exactly/.


# Path to Prod

## Strategy Details

- **Description:** Deposits USDC to Exactly Variable Rate Pool, earns fees and OP tokens rewards, sells OP for more USDC and deposits again.
- **Strategy current APR:** 2.19% on USDC and 2,10% on OP 
- **Does Strategy delegate assets?:** No.
- **Target Prod Vault:** 0.4.5
- **BaseStrategy Version #:** 0.4.5




## Testing Plan

### Ape.tax

- **Will Ape.tax be used?:** Yes
- **Will Ape.tax vault be same version # as prod vault?:** Yes
- **What conditions are needed to graduate? (e.g. number of harvest cycles, min funds, etc):** Be profitable.

## Prod Deployment Plan

- **Suggested position in withdrawQueue?:**
- **Does strategy have any deposit/withdraw fees?:** No.
- **Suggested debtRatio?:** start with 5 - 10%
- **Suggested max debtRatio to scale to?:** should be analized.



## Emergency Plan

- **Shutdown Plan:** withdraw from exactly, claim and sell rewards, return want to vault
- **Is it safe to...**
  - call EmergencyShutdown
  - remove from withdrawQueue
  - call revoke and then harvest
